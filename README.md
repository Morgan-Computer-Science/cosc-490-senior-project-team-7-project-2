<h1>SENTINEL</h1>
<p><strong>Presidential Decision Support System</strong><br/>
Simulation Project for Educational Use</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
SENTINEL is a multi-agent AI decision support system designed to assist executive-level
decision making. The system synthesizes analysis across multiple national interest domains
and produces structured decision memoranda that present policy options, tradeoffs, risks,
and recommendations.
</p>

<p>
SENTINEL is advisory by design. It does not make decisions or issue directives. Authority
remains with the human decision maker.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br/>
This project is a fictional simulation created solely for academic and research purposes.
It does not represent any real government system, policy, or authority.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Model traditional executive decision-making workflows using AI agents</li>
  <li>Explore multi-agent orchestration and conflict resolution</li>
  <li>Design a human-centered interface for high-stakes decisions</li>
  <li>Improve transparency, consistency, and traceability in advisory systems</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>System Concept</h2>
<p>
High-level executive decisions are traditionally informed through layered staff coordination,
agency input, and structured decision memoranda. SENTINEL digitally models this process
using coordinated AI agents that emulate advisory roles while preserving human authority.
</p>

<p>
The primary system output is a <strong>Draft Response</strong>, a structured decision memo equivalent
to what a President would review prior to making a final decision.
</p>

<h2>System Architecture</h2>

<h3>High-Level Workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>A policy question is introduced into the system</li>
  <li>SENTINEL classifies the decision context</li>
  <li>Relevant advisory agents are activated</li>
  <li>Agents analyze independently within domain boundaries</li>
  <li>Conflicts, risks, and uncertainties are surfaced</li>
  <li>A Draft Response is assembled for executive review</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h2>Advisory Agents</h2>

<h3>Top-Level Agents</h3>
<p>
Each top-level agent represents a core national interest domain and contributes
domain-specific analysis.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Economic Stability Agent</li>
  <li>Inflation and Prices Agent</li>
  <li>Jobs and Labor Agent</li>
  <li>National Security Agent</li>
  <li>International Relations Agent</li>
  <li>Energy and Infrastructure Agent</li>
  <li>Cybersecurity Agent</li>
  <li>Public Health and Resilience Agent</li>
  <li>Immigration and Border Operations Agent</li>
  <li>Civil Rights and Social Stability Agent</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shared Sub-Agent Structure</h3>
<p>
Each top-level agent is internally composed of layered sub-agents to ensure depth,
realism, and accountability.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evidence Retrieval</li>
  <li>Scenario and Forecast Analysis</li>
  <li>Policy Options Generation</li>
  <li>Risk and Second-Order Effects Analysis</li>
  <li>Metrics and Monitoring</li>
  <li>Legal and Authority Review</li>
  <li>Red Team Challenge</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>User Views</h2>

<h3>Presidential View</h3>
<p>
A minimal, decision-focused interface designed for rapid comprehension under time pressure.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Active Draft Response</li>
  <li>Three clearly differentiated policy options</li>
  <li>Risk and legal constraint summaries</li>
  <li>Confidence and uncertainty indicators</li>
  <li>Requests for clarification or what-if analysis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analyst View (Conceptual)</h3>
<p>
An internal perspective used for transparency and system oversight.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agent outputs and assumptions</li>
  <li>Source inspection</li>
  <li>Conflict resolution</li>
  <li>System confidence monitoring</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Key System Output: Draft Response</h2>
<p>
The Draft Response is the central artifact produced by SENTINEL.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Situation summary</li>
  <li>Decision required</li>
  <li>Operational and legal constraints</li>
  <li>Three policy options</li>
  <li>Recommended course of action</li>
  <li>Risks and uncertainties</li>
  <li>Legal and authority considerations</li>
  <li>Confidence and disagreement indicators</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Technology Context</h2>
<p>
SENTINEL is conceptually designed around modern AI agent orchestration principles,
including large language models, structured prompts, and tool-assisted reasoning.
The system emphasizes human-centered decision support rather than automation.

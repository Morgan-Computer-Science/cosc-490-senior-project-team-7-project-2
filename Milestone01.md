<h2>Milestone 1: Research and Mockup Design</h2>

<p>
Milestone 1 focuses on grounding the SENTINEL system in real-world executive
decision-making practices and translating those findings into validated interface
mockups and interaction flows. All wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and interaction
prototypes are produced in

<h3>1.1 Research Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand how presidential and executive decisions are traditionally supported</li>
  <li>Identify the role of software systems versus human coordination</li>
  <li>Determine gaps between existing tools and executive-level decision needs</li>
  <li>Translate findings into a decision-first, low-cognitive-load interface design</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Research Findings: Executive Decision Support Landscape</h3>

<p>
A review of publicly documented executive decision-support practices indicates that
no single application currently performs unified, cross-domain policy synthesis or
autonomously generates decision options for presidential review. Instead, decision
support is distributed across specialized tools, structured briefings, and
human-led coordination processes.
</p>

<p>
At the federal level, presidential decisions are informed through products such as
the Presidential Daily Brief, which focuses on intelligence synthesis and uncertainty
reporting rather than policy recommendation
(<a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/what-we-do/briefings/presidential-daily-brief" target="_blank">Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a>).
Similarly, National Security Council processes rely on staff coordination and option
papers prepared by human experts rather than automated advisory systems
(<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/" target="_blank">White House National Security Council</a>).
</p>

<p>
Commercial platforms used by government and enterprise organizations, such as
Palantir Gotham, provide advanced data integration and situational awareness
capabilities but do not generate executive policy recommendations or structured
decision memoranda
(<a href="https://www.palantir.com/platforms/gotham/" target="_blank">Palantir Gotham</a>).
Likewise, economic and crisis modeling tools used by agencies support scenario
analysis within narrow domains rather than cross-domain executive synthesis
(<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data" target="_blank">Congressional Budget Office</a>).
</p>

<p>
These findings suggest that existing systems support executive decision making
indirectly through analysis, modeling, and briefing preparation, while the synthesis
of tradeoffs, legal constraints, and recommendations remains a human responsibility.
SENTINEL is therefore positioned as a conceptual design exploration that examines how
coordinated AI agents could augment existing workflows by producing structured,
transparent, and advisory decision memoranda without replacing human authority.

<h3>1.3 UX Implications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Executive interfaces must prioritize clarity and option comparison over raw data</li>
  <li>Decision artifacts should mirror traditional option memo structures</li>
  <li>Trust indicators such as confidence, disagreement, and data freshness are critical</li>
  <li>AI capabilities must remain advisory and interpretable</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3>1.4 Design Artifacts (Figma)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Low-fidelity wireframes for Presidential Home and Decision Brief views</li>
  <li>High-fidelity mockups emphasizing one-minute decision comprehension</li>
  <li>Reusable component library for option cards, risk badges, and confidence indicators</li>
  <li>Clickable interaction flows implemented as Figma prototypes</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3>1.5 Interaction Flows</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>New Decision Flow:</strong> Home → Enter policy question → Generate Draft Response → Review options</li>
  <li><strong>Review Flow:</strong> Home → Open Draft Response → Compare Option A/B/C → Expand risks and constraints</li>
  <li><strong>What-If Flow:</strong> Decision Brief → Select scenario toggle → Update impacts and confidence</li>
</ol>
